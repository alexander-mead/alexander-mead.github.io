            <p>The evolution of structure in the cosmos is a complicated process in which small-amplitude initial seed fluctuations in density are amplified by gravity. These then detach from the mean background expansion and collapse to bound structures which then may virialise and merge with other collapsed structures. The equations governing this are complicated and non-linear, and must be solved by computers and the resulting simulations analysed to try and glean understanding of the gravitatiaonl amplification processes. This is complicated in three dimensions because the phase space is six dimensional and cannot be visualised easily. A simplified example of collapse in only one spatial dimension is easier to analyse as the phase space is then two dimensional. Physically, this corresponds to a three-dimensional universe in which the perturbations are all set up to be parrallel and sheet like. The force between these parallel sheets is then constant as a function of distance between them. The sheets never deviate from being parallel and hence can always be described by a position and a velocity. The movie below shows the phase-space density of collapse of a series of these parallel sheets with periodic boundary conditions imposed. The horizontal axis is position while the vertical axis is velocity. A higher density of sheets is indicated by whiter colours. As the collapse occurs the initial perturbed phase space forms spirals that then wind round themselves and each other as collapse progresses. The continuity of the phase space, and the constantcy of the density can be seen as despite the chaotic behaviour there are never any discontinuities and the density merely gets stretched, smeared and squashed. In the real cosmological collapse of cold dark matter this type of phase space mixing and spirals are expect at all scales, but in six dimensions rather than just two.</p>
