To transfer this to the UBC PHAS server you should use FileZilla. FileZilla does not seem to work from UBC so I should do this transfer from home. Also I need to 'quick connect' to the sftp address.

One can also `ssh -Y mead@ssh.phas.ubc.ca` and then the public webpages are in `/www/pubHtml/mead`. There is a symbolic link to this in my home directory `/home/mead`.

This UBC PHAS version of the website lives here: http://www.phas.ubc.ca/~mead/
