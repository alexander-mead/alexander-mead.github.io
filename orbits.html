              This movie shows a blue planet orbiting a red star in a special
              way that is called 'spin-orbit resonance', where the spin period
              of the planet is connected to the orbital period by a simple
              ratio. In this example, the planet spins exactly three times on
              its axis for every two orbits of the star. The right-hand side of
              the movie shows the orbit, while the left-hand side shows the flux
              received and what the sun looks like from the point of view of an
              observer on the equator of the planet at the location of the large
              arrow. A 3:2 spin-orbit resonance is exactly the configuration of
              the planet Mercury. For comparison, the Earth spins ~366 times per
              orbit (not ~365, think about it!), and is not in a resonant
              configuration. Tidal forces exerted by the Sun on Mercury are
              thought to be responsible for driving it into this 3:2 spin-orbit
              resonance, much in the same way that tidal forces from Earth have
              driven the Moon into a 1:1 spin-orbit resonance, which is why you
              only ever see one face of the moon.

              It is thought that some eccentricity is required to drive planets
              into resonances such as 3:2, and in the previous example the orbit
              of the planet was circular. In this movie, the orbit has changed
              to be mildly eccentric, with e = 0.15. The large arrow denotes the
              'up' direction from the point of view of our observer: the sun is
              directly overhead when this arrow is pointing towards the star and
              this is then mid-day. The two smaller arrows indicate the horizon
              and when one of these is pointing towards the star; it would be
              either sunrise or sunset for our observer. Note that the passage
              of the sun slows down in the sky around mid-day, which is a bit
              strange. A quick look at the previous movies, combined with a
              small amount of thinking, will convince you that one 'day' lasts
              two 'years' (orbital periods) for our observer, and that the
              system is exactly periodic over two orbital periods. Is this
              interesting? Maybe a bit.

              Things get more interesting when we consider higher eccentricities
              for the same 3:2 system, such as in this movie where e = 0.25. The
              eccentricity means two things for our observer: First, that the
              distance to the sun changed appreciably over one orbit, hence the
              sun in the sky appears larger or smaller depending on the orbital
              phase. Second, the angular velocity changes significantly over the
              orbit, with it being fastest when the planet is closest to the sun
              and vice versa. Note that the sun actually moves backwards in the
              sky here around mid-day! How the sun transitions across the sky
              for our observer depends on a competition between the (constant)
              angular-spin rate of the planet and the (not constant)
              angular-orbit rate. For these higher eccentricities the increased
              orbital angular speed around the point of orbital closest approach
              means that actually the sun moves backwards in the sky for a short
              time, prolonging the mid-day for our observer.

              Things get stranger if we consider our observer to be at a
              different longitude on the surface of the planet, such as in this
              movie. In this case the 'day' is actually broken up into three
              distinct phases of daylight and the sun will rise thrice and set
              thrice throughout the 'day'. For this longitude, this manifests as
              one longer period of daylight when the planet is furthest from the
              sun and then two short bursts of light with the sun closer, but
              low in the sky. Note that this also means that the total received
              flux, and the rate at which this flux is deposited, varies as a
              function of planetary longitude, as well as the standard
              latitudinal dependence. This is different to Earth, where all
              longitudes are equivalent in terms of the flux they receive over a
              year.

              As the eccentricity becomes more extreme so does the weird
              behaviour. When e = 0.4, as in this example, the observer receives
              more instantaneous flux from the short sunset-sunrise times than
              they do during the longer day, so the best tanning time occurs
              when the sun is low in the sky, but compensatingly close. There is
              a critical value of the eccentricity at which the retrograde
              motion of the sun and the corresponding strange behaviour becomes
              possible. It turns out that this can be obtained as the solution
              to a cubic equation, and the critical eccentricity is ~0.193. The
              eccentricity of Mercury is ~0.205 so the retrograde motion of the
              Sun would only be visible for a short time, and there are only
              very specific longitudes on the surface of Mercury when you would
              see a triple sunrise phenomenon over the course of one 'day',
              which on Mercury lasts for ~176 Earth days.

              This may all seem like an academic exercise, but many planets have
              been discovered around low-mass stars, and the habitable zone for
              these stars is much closer to the star compared to that around our
              Sun. The relative importance of tidal forces increases more
              quickly than the gravitational force as you go near a star, it has
              an r-cubed dependence rather than r-squared, so planets in the
              habitable zone around low-mass stars are expected to be in
              spin-orbit coupled configurations. These could be 1:1, like the
              Moon-Earth resonance, but other situations such as 3:2, 2:1, 5:2,
              ... are also possible. So there could be funny aliens out there in
              the cosmos who have a very different conception of what a day
              means compared to that which we have on earth. These aliens would
              also have to get used to the fact that the total received flux in
              one 'day' varies as a function of longitude.
